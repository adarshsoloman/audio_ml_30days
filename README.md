## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd audio_ml_30days
```

### 2. Set Up Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate (Linux/Mac)
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies (week-specific)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Follow Weekly Modules

Each week's folder contains:
- `README.md` - Week-specific instructions
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- Project code & notebooks

---

## 📚 Learning Resources

**Recommended Reading:**
- [Hugging Face Audio Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/audio-course)
- [PyTorch Audio Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/speech_command_classification_with_torchaudio_tutorial.html)
- [librosa Documentation](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html)

**Datasets Used:**
- [ESC-50](https://github.com/karolpiczak/ESC-50) - Environmental sound classification
- [Google Speech Commands](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/speech_commands) - Keyword spotting
- [NTREX](https://github.com/MicrosoftTranslator/NTREX) - Multilingual evaluation (if needed)

---

## ⚙️ Working Principles

- **4–5 focused hours/day max** (no burnout)
- **1 rest day per week**
- **Finish before starting new** (no scope creep)
- **Build working systems > theoretical perfection**
- **Consistency > intensity**

---

## 🎓 Interview Prep Checklist

By end of sprint, be able to explain:

- [ ] What is a spectrogram and why is it useful?
- [ ] Why use mel scale for audio processing?
- [ ] What are MFCCs and their applications?
- [ ] How does CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) work?
- [ ] Difference between Whisper and Wav2Vec2?
- [ ] Challenges faced in your projects + solutions

---

## 🏆 Success Metrics

**By March 15, 2026:**

- ✅ 3 clean GitHub repositories
- ✅ 1 live demo (publicly accessible)
- ✅ Updated resume + LinkedIn
- ✅ 25–40 applications submitted
- ✅ 3–5 interview conversations initiated

---

## 🚨 Ground Rules

**AVOID:**
- ❌ Adding features beyond roadmap
- ❌ Switching projects mid-week
- ❌ Premature optimization
- ❌ Quantum ML rabbit holes (not yet!)
- ❌ Overworking and burning out

**FOCUS ON:**
- ✅ Simple, working implementations
- ✅ Clear documentation
- ✅ Demonstrable results
- ✅ Consistent daily progress

## 📈 Progress Tracking

| Week | Status | Deliverables | Completion |
|------|--------|--------------|------------|
| Week 1 | 🚧 In Progress | Audio basics + Classification | 0% |
| Week 2 | ⏳ Upcoming | ASR System | 0% |
| Week 3 | ⏳ Upcoming | Voice Cloning | 0% |
| Week 4 | ⏳ Upcoming | Deploy + Apply | 0% |

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (Post-Sprint)

After securing internship competence:
- Deepen signal processing knowledge
- Fine-tuning advanced models
- Production ML practices (monitoring, CI/CD)
- Quantum ML exploration (**Month 6+ only**)
